If its multi threaded its possible that the m_stateVarMap will not be cleared before the if check.\n\nDoes this code need to worry about entry by multiple threads?  If the code is multi-threaded we need a mutex lock before the if statement.  If not multi-threaded the code is fine.",

This is the whole idea behind this particular commit.\nIn case of incorrect sequence of service removal, nothing terrible would really happen except nasty messages from gupnp informing us that the \"object is not a proxy\".
